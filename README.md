# machinelearning


a deep learning classifier for any binary image classification task of your choice. The 
deep-learning classifier should consist of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers 
followed by the final output layer for image classification. Motivate the choice of the model. Use 
appropriate metrics to evaluate the model on the test set. Compare the performance of your deep 
learning model with three traditional machine learning models of your choice evaluated on the 
same test set.
